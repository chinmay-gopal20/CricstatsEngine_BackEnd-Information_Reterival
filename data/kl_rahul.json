{"profile": "A tearaway fast bowler from Jharkhand, Rahul Shukla made waves in the Indian Premier League with his extreme and at times erratic pace. Despite having modest outings since his Ranji debut during the 2009-10 season, Shukla was picked up by the Mumbai Indians and made his IPL debut during the 2012 season, then by Rajasthan Royals in 2013 and by Delhi Daredevils in the following season.\n\nAlong with Varun Aaron, Rahul Shukla formed an useful if not dangerous opening combination for Jharkhand, but his inability to take wickets as a strike bowler meant he wasn't always part of the first eleven in four-day cricket. In the white-ball forms of the game, he still remains an useful asset, although chances of him gaining the attention of IPL franchises looks bleak.\n\nBy Pradeep Krishnamurthy\nAs of September 2018"}
